#task 2
bmi.py goal to 
calucate bmi giving the end user the ability to enter their own height and weight in si units  
used fromula for bmi provided 
inputs for weight and height were based of the tiles sample project 

#task 3

second string 
Goal:Write a program that takes asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order.
uses input method with string prompt.
created reversed variable
0 is where counting starts for the first character in the secetence 
100000 is large for the purpose of allowing much longer sentences to be resvered not just the prompt
2 is used to make it only count every second variable 

# task 4

collatz.py
goal:Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
 At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, 
if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
Have the program end if the current value is one.
x is used for any given positive integer
y is defined as two to determine if its an even or odd number
while is used to create a loop that will end when x is equal to 1
x % y is used to see if a remainder is created.This allows the program to determine if the number is even or odd
if x is even it is devided by two.
else clause is used if a remainder is created from x%y
then the number is multiplied by 3 and 1.Brackets are not need as the order of operation is the desired outcome

task 5
weekday.py
Goal: Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday
references :
https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/current-datetime
https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_date.asp
datetime was imported 
the variable now was created which inputs the current day and time 
a diction was created which between 0-4 creates the response "Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.
0-4 refers to monday to friday 
5 and 6 create the respone "Its is the weekend yay!"
5 and 6 refer to saturday and sundays
y uses the dictionary to get the approiate response for the current weekday
print(y) returns this response
